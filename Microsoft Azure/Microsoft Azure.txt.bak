PP.simple interface for members(userfriendly front-end) But how is it secure?
it is acctually a consortum blockchain platform which can connect to existing evm compliers like remix,truffle
and it after that it result it diffrent apps like granche
------------
Q?how is identifiers off chain( i mean what's the diffrence between this and simple blockchain) ? - who is agent? actually microsoft is the owner of this app? so why don't have access to private key??
----------
P.as a result being cocorsum DIDs needs to be verified and accepted by tristed providers
But timeStates can be verified without need to any other third party.
for example a university can become a verifier for a part of web ( actually his student)
----------------
P.authentication is one of the most important kind of interacting with other DIDs . azure algorithm is that :
 The external party looks
up the DID via the DIF Universal Resolver
(probably by using a DID User Agent app),
and the resolver returns the matching DPKI
metadata. The external party generates a
challenge by using the public key references
in the DPKI metadata and performs a
handshake with the user. If the user is
able to complete the challenge-response
handshake, it’s been proven that the user
is the owner of DID in question . 
sth like public private and signiture
FIDO/WebAuthn
-----------------
P*>DIF Identity Hubs are based on usercontrolled, off-chain, personal datastores
------------------
P. you’re not required to
use a provider for your Identity Hub at
all: Identity Hubs are open source server
technology that you can run on any
device or infrastructure


*diffrence bteween cloude & blockchain
*real projects on azure 
*is it a platform or we can write our blockchain on our computer on it
